# Find the BigO notation of you solution
Task 1:
time complexity of my first problem is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n).
Task 2:
the loop iterates over each element once, the time complexity is directly proportional to the size of the array, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n). and same space complexity 0(n)

# If possible write the pseudocode of a solution that would be more optimized
