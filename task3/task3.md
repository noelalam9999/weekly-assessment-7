# Find the BigO notation of you solution
Here it will be O(array.length * n).
Because the first iteration is being done over the array. And inside it, there's another iteration that's being done based on n.

In the best case, it will be O(array.length) when n=1, because we will have to loop over the array only once

# If possible write the pseudocode of a solution that would be more optimized
I can't think of anything
